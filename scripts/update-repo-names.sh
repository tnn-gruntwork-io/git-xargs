# Therefore, to make our regex more readable, we are declaring clearly-named variables for the special characters we
# want to match, and including those in a string with no need for escaping or crazy concatenation

# folders, binary files, and other files we shouldn't be touching. Note that we also skip .go, go.mod, and go.sum

# Go gives a "module declares its path as: <OLD NAME>" error. So the only way to use the new names with Go code is to
# publish new versions, but to do that, we'd have to build a dependency graph, update repos and publish new versions in
# the right order, update the code to use these new versions, and fix any backwards incompatibilities in these new
# versions, which is far work than we're willing to do for a version number bump right now.
